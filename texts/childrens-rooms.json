    "My sons, Daniel, Julien, and Gabriel, resident sportsmen, daze through sorry\nrooms while I write a strict, stern paragraph. One of them stutters, protests\ninjustice; another struts testily; the third pets our nineteen stuffed foxes.\nIt's easier to find warm coffee than mild peace. I kick a bad ball, ever\npeeved. Quick, I strain to see the end of this before they're done. They\nattempt to fit in unusual stuff: a cactus, really? Such a stormy view from\norbit on high, I see abstruse structures, unmade beds, and avidly stretch\ntoward the even sonnet, a tactical cannon of sorts.",
    "This sonnet has been crafted to comprise\nfive hundred sixty characters precisely,\nbut filler as its ink may be (surprise),\nit fits its witty argument quite nicely.\nFour hundred fifty-five letters as loom,\none hundred five non-letters in between,\nit sings about the structure of its room\nand, even as it does so, paints a scene.\nFour sentences that gather thus to jell—\nfour stanzas that would rather be apart—\nstrain, as a service crew at some hotel,\nto pick up the debris and make it smart.\nOne hundred words come joyfully together\nto admire this sonnet's cap and feather."
