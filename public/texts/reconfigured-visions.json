    "Faerie enchantment, stroke of trickery\nin anagrams enciphered what awe wrought.\nOne tastes the clever portent yet cannot\ncook up the wedded, shrewd duplicity.\nSame old walled-in Oulipian, I see\nI'm soon a voodoo Merlin, rapt in thought,\ndefeated, dazed by this fake Camelot,\nediting wedding details poured on me.\nCompiled Shakespearean poet hones wild task,\njotting down two swell poems, as I mask\none common site for each, a letter-terse\nhomeroom the potted muses deem some curse.\nI fidget to dash off my wonder. Quick,\nI project flowers elsewhere, oh so slick!",
    "To show me how her wicked project loops,\nDeceit had managed to project her reel\nagainst my bedroom wall, a wound of leer\nscarring within me as she wound the spool.\nAnd I decided, for the sake of mood,\nto serve aperitifs: \"It's sake time.\"\nI drank and prayed Agape would emit\nhaze from her scented mouth agape with doom.\nOnscreen, the gods, it seems, desert yet keep\nscattering sand clouds like some desert wolf.\nI lie to sense the movie's content flow\ntoo quickly to take form. Content to peek,\nI wonder why, and while a minute peels,\nI slip from the minute account and sleep.",
    "Fortuna's echoed legends are foretold\nwhen, one odd meteor zooming past the place,\nentropic time endears me with the cold\ncommand of every edge inside the space.\nWhat wonder trick would pesky phantoms see\ninside the queer, true, deeper room, as they\ntoil with the softer deck of wood for me\nI seek the luck some of the Greeks display.\nTwo poems led in to deem a tangled fate,\nin abject echo of our disrepair,\nI jot a clock (I contemplate and wait),\nas letters swap and words dissolve in air.\nThe muses, plucking what tremendous moon,\nwill ink enigma so that I may swoon."
